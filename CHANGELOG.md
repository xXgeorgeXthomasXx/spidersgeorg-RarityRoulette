## [1.2.0] - 2025-09-9

- Fixed a silly little bug where the revolvers acted as blowguns when used side by side with the PEAK Blow Darts mod after a shot or two!
- Also: you can change the max (randomized) shots the revolver has! I've added it to the config for your modification needs. The default is a max of 2 shots, but feel free to change it as you please!

## [1.1.0] - 2025-09-9

- Changed the shots the revolver can have since a max of 6 seemed excessive, especially if you get super super rare items, now the max is 2!
- OOPS! ALL REVOLVERS!! Removed the ability to spawn a revolver FROM the revolver since that was a possibility before sometimes resulting in a chain of getting revolvers over and over again

## [1.0.0] - 2025-09-8

- Initial release.
