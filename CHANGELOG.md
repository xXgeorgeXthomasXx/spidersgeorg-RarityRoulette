## [1.8.0] - 2025-11-28

- THE ONE WHERE YOU CAN BONK YOUR FRIENDS
- IM FULL OF TURKEY AND WANTED TO BE PRODUCTIVE
- Finished a revolver? Bonk a friend! Haven't finished a revolver? Bonk a friend! Just throw that thing!

## [1.7.0] - 2025-11-21

- AYOO Revolvers don't spawn in the birds nests anymore!! If further spawn control is desired, [Tony](https://thunderstore.io/c/peak/p/tony4twenty/) was kind enough to integrate the revolver into his [Peak Luggage Items Mod](https://thunderstore.io/c/peak/p/tony4twenty/PEAK_Luggage_Items/), so if you want further customization of spawnrates/locations, go check it out 😄 !
- ALSO you can now control the damage of the revolver! It keeps the original 50% damage value if you haven't changed the value in the config, OR, you can increase or decrease the damage as you please! Please keep the value a number between 0.0 to 1.0 for the mod to work correctly! (Example, 1.0 for 100% damage, 0.54 for 54% damage, etc)((Also if you haven't run the game after downloading this version, I think you have to run it once for the value to actually show up in your config if i remember right!)) I highly recommend everyone in your party sets it to the same value as I have not tested different values between different player! (If you do....good luck to you)

## [1.6.0] - 2025-11-16

- Im a sham of a developer and it broke AGAIN I'm so sorry 😿 I think it works again though!! It was also brought to my attention that having the revolver spawn into nests as a gag wasn't the best idea since eggs are a great food source in that biome! Unfortunately, my unity project is super borked so this will have to be slated until the next release, but it is coming up soon!

## [1.5.0] - 2025-09-29

- It has been brought to my attention that this mod was broken AF, i'm so sorry... A patch has been put into place for the time being so the mod should work as it did before!! While we await the next patch to the game that may or may not break it again, I will be in search for a better solution to my troubles... to OUR troubles

## [1.4.0] - 2025-09-12

- Removed the remaining item use bar from above the item icon since you're intended to gamble on how many shots you have left too 😉

## [1.3.0] - 2025-09-9

- Hi i'm sorry I changed the default max shots to 4 please don't hate me

## [1.2.0] - 2025-09-9

- Fixed a silly little bug where the revolvers acted as blowguns when used side by side with the PEAK Blow Darts mod after a shot or two!
- Also: you can change the max (randomized) shots the revolver has! I've added it to the config for your modification needs. The default is a max of 2 shots, but feel free to change it as you please!

## [1.1.0] - 2025-09-9

- Changed the shots the revolver can have since a max of 6 seemed excessive, especially if you get super super rare items, now the max is 2!
- OOPS! ALL REVOLVERS!! Removed the ability to spawn a revolver FROM the revolver since that was a possibility before sometimes resulting in a chain of getting revolvers over and over again

## [1.0.0] - 2025-09-8

- Initial release.
