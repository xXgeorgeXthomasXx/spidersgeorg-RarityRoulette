## [1.5.0] - 2025-09-29

- It has been brought to my attention that this mod was broken AF, i'm so sorry... A patch has been put into place for the time being so the mod should work as it did before!! While we await the next patch to the game that may or may not break it again, I will be in search for a better solution to my troubles... to OUR troubles

## [1.4.0] - 2025-09-12

- Removed the remaining item use bar from above the item icon since you're intended to gamble on how many shots you have left too 😉

## [1.3.0] - 2025-09-9

- Hi i'm sorry I changed the default max shots to 4 please don't hate me

## [1.2.0] - 2025-09-9

- Fixed a silly little bug where the revolvers acted as blowguns when used side by side with the PEAK Blow Darts mod after a shot or two!
- Also: you can change the max (randomized) shots the revolver has! I've added it to the config for your modification needs. The default is a max of 2 shots, but feel free to change it as you please!

## [1.1.0] - 2025-09-9

- Changed the shots the revolver can have since a max of 6 seemed excessive, especially if you get super super rare items, now the max is 2!
- OOPS! ALL REVOLVERS!! Removed the ability to spawn a revolver FROM the revolver since that was a possibility before sometimes resulting in a chain of getting revolvers over and over again

## [1.0.0] - 2025-09-8

- Initial release.
