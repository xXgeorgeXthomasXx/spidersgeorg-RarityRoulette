# Rarity Roulette
Try your luck!! Imagine russian roulette, except instead of walking away, you get a chance at spawning in-biome loot! A N Y in-biome loot...

---

## How It Works
This mod spawns in Revolvers throughout the chests (and one mystery location)! The revolver will have a randomly set number of uses, and when used, either damages a player for 50% of their health, or drops a random item within the current biomes spawn pool! This means ANYTHING in the current biomes spawn pool! however, you have a decent chance of inflicting damage on yourself, or your friends! Standard left click lets you try it on your friends (I hope your aim is good!) and right click lets you test your own luck! If your inventory is full, the items should spawn above you and drop at your feet.

## Notes
All users will need the mode for the mod to function! (I think!)

---

After the first launch, a config file will be generated that you can modify at:

BepInEx/config/spidersgeorg-RarityRoulette.cfg

### Config Options:

| Setting               | Description                                             | Default |
|------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|---------|
| `Max Shots` | The maximum number of shots the revolver can randomly have            | `2` |
